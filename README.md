# BMI
**BMI (Body Mass Index)** is a simple calculation used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters (kg/mÂ²). BMI helps categorize individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
